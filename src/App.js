/* From the React website:
"If you have extra time or want to practice your new React skills, here are some ideas for improvements that you could make to the tic-tac-toe game, listed in order of increasing difficulty:

For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
Throughout this tutorial, you’ve touched on React concepts including elements, components, props, and state. Now that you’ve seen how these concepts work when building a game, check out Thinking in React to see how the same React concepts work when build an app’s UI."
